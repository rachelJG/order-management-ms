# üß© Order Management Service

**Order Management Service** is a Go-based microservice that manages the lifecycle of delivery orders within a logistics platform.
It allows registering new orders, querying orders by client or status, and updating their delivery state.
The service leverages **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **Kafka** to implement persistence, caching, and asynchronous event-driven communication.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Register new orders**
* **Query orders** by client or status
* **Update order state** and emit asynchronous events
* **Cache frequent queries** using Redis
* **Persist data** in MongoDB
* **Publish domain events** to Kafka when an order changes state

---

## üß† Architecture Overview

This microservice follows clean architecture principles and includes:

* REST API for communication (`gin`)
* MongoDB repository for order persistence
* Redis cache layer for optimized reads
* Kafka producer for event publishing (In topic "order_events" when order state changes)
* Configurable environment variables

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally

### 1. Prerequisites

* Go 1.23+
* Docker & Docker Compose
* File .env configured with the environment variables. (Example: .env.example)

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rachelJG/order-management-ms.git
cd order-management-ms
```
Copy the environment variables file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open .env and adjust the variables as needed (ports, credentials, topic names, etc).

### 3. Build and start the services

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
This will:
- Build all Docker images based on your local Dockerfile
- Start all services defined in docker-compose.yml (for example: API, database, Kafka, Zookeeper, etc.)

The service will start at `http://localhost:8080`

### 4. Stop the services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 5. Check running containers
```bash
docker ps
```

### 6. Check logs
```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

## üß™ API Examples

### Create a new order

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "1233",
    "items": [
      {
        "sku": "JNS-CLS-32",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }'

```

### Get order by id

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders/ORD-e7825df7
```

### Query orders by client and status

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders?status=NEW&page=1&limit=10"
```

### Update order state

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders/ORD-12b72b69/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
  }'

```

### Project Structure

The project follows a clean and modular architecture to maintain separation of concerns and scalability.

```bash
src/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go
``` 

# config/

Contains configuration files and initialization logic for external dependencies such as environment variables, database connections, Kafka, etc.

# controllers/

You define the HTTP handlers that receive incoming requests, validate input data, and call the corresponding service layer functions.
They represent the presentation layer of the application.

# models/

Includes the data models and structures used across the project, such as database entities and API request/response models.

# pkg/

Holds reusable helper packages and utilities (e.g., logging, Kafka producer/consumer, middlewares).
This folder can be imported by other layers when needed.

# repositories/

Implements the data access logic.
Each repository interacts directly with the database or external storage using libraries like GORM or MongoDB drivers.

# services/

Contains the business logic of the application.
Services act as intermediaries between controllers and repositories, encapsulating use case‚Äìspecific operations.

# main.go

The entry point of the application.
It loads the configuration, initializes dependencies, sets up routes, and starts the HTTP server.
