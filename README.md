# üß© Order Management Service

**Order Management Service** is a Go-based microservice that manages the lifecycle of delivery orders within a logistics platform.
It allows registering new orders, querying orders by client or status, and updating their delivery state.
The service leverages **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **Kafka** to implement persistence, caching, and asynchronous event-driven communication.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Register new orders**
* **Query orders** by client or status
* **Update order state** and emit asynchronous events
* **Cache frequent queries** using Redis
* **Persist data** in MongoDB
* **Publish domain events** to Kafka when an order changes state

---

## üß† Architecture Overview

This microservice follows clean architecture principles and includes:

* REST API for communication (`gin`)
* MongoDB repository for order persistence
* Redis cache layer for optimized reads
* Kafka producer for event publishing (In topic "order_events" when order state changes)
* Configurable environment variables

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally

### 1. Prerequisites

* Go 1.23+
* Docker & Docker Compose

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/order-management-ms.git
cd order-management-ms
```

### 3. Start dependencies (MongoDB, Redis, Kafka)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Run the service

```bash
go run ./cmd/api
```

The service will start at `http://localhost:8080`

## üß™ API Examples

### Create a new order

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "client_id": "client-123",
        "items": [
          {"sku": "P001", "name": "Package A", "quantity": 2, "price": 50.0}
        ]
      }'
```

### Query orders by client and status

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/orders?client_id=client-123&state=created"
```

### Update order state

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/orders/uuid-123/state \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"new_state": "in_transit"}'
```

## üß© Future Improvements

* Add authentication and authorization
* Include metrics (Prometheus) and tracing (OpenTelemetry)
* Add pagination and sorting for query endpoints
